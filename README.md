# 🧠 AI Training Schedule Agent

**A simple AI-based scheduling agent** that automatically arranges training sessions according to teacher availability — ensuring **no time clashes** and a smooth weekly timetable (Monday–Friday).

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project uses a **rule-based AI system** to read teacher availability (from CSV or PDF files) and generate an optimized **weekly schedule**.
It demonstrates how AI agents can automate scheduling tasks efficiently using Python.

## ⚙️ Files Explanation

### 1. `agent.py`

Contains the main AI Agent class `TrainingAgent`.

**Main Functions:**

* `__init__`: Loads data from the given file (CSV or PDF).
* `plan_schedule`: Calls the scheduler to create a timetable.
* `show_schedule`: Displays the final schedule.
* `export_to_csv`: Saves the schedule as a CSV file.

---

### 2. `scheduler.py`

Handles **scheduling logic** — assigns teachers to available time slots without overlap.

**Main Functions:**

* `parse_time_range`: Converts time ranges like “9-11 AM” into numeric form.
* `overlap`: Checks if two time periods overlap.
* `schedule_sessions`: Generates a weekly, non-clashing schedule (Mon–Fri).

---

### 3. `utils.py`

Processes and loads teacher availability data from **CSV or PDF** files.

**Main Functions:**

* `load_availability_data`: Reads and formats the data into structured form.

---

### 4. `main.py`

The **entry point** of the project.
It creates the agent, generates the schedule, displays it, and exports it to CSV.

**Steps:**

1. Load data from `availability.csv`.
2. Generate schedule using the AI agent.
3. Display and save the schedule.

---

### 5. `requirements.txt`

Lists all dependencies:

* pandas
* pdfplumber
* numpy
* openpyxl

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Follow these steps to run or share the project:

1. Open the folder `training_schedule_agent`.
2. Open **Command Prompt / Terminal** inside the folder.
3. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Place your teacher availability file inside the `data` folder and name it:

   ```
   availability.csv
   ```
5. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
6. The AI Agent will:

   * Read the availability file
   * Plan the schedule
   * Display it on the screen
   * Save it as `weekly_schedule.csv`

---

## 🧩 Summary

This project showcases a **rule-based AI scheduling system** that:

* Reads teacher availability
* Avoids scheduling conflicts
* Automatically produces a structured, weekly timetable

It’s a simple yet effective example of how AI automation can improve scheduling processes.
